# EmfrpWatch
These are implementations for a digital watch example written in Emfrp / switch-extended Emfrp.  
These samples has been created to evaluate switch-extension for Emfrp.

* `src/pure` : exapmle code written in original Emfrp
* `src/pure2` : extended version of `pure`
* `src/switch` : example code written in extended Emfrp
* `src/switch2` : extended version of `switch`

Files named `WatchMainGen.mfrp` (in `switch` and `switch2`) are generated by the switch-extension compiler.

## Requirements
* [Emfrp](https://github.com/psg-titech/emfrp)
* [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org)
* [M5Stack Core](http://www.m5stack.com/)
